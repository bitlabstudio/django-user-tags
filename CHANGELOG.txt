- added setting USER_TAGS_RELATED_NAME with default `user_tags_tagged_items` to
  avoid name clashes with `django-tagging`.

- BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: TAG_FIELDS is no longer a list of 3-tuples
  but a list of dictionaries. See README for more info. As a result we now
  support to define a help_text for the tags form field.
